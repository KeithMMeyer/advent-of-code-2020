# Advent of Code 2020
This is the collections of code samples I used for the [2020 Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
These samples are not the prettiest, well documented, or most efficient code: it is the fastest code I could write at midnight on each day of December 2020.

The majority of my code was written in about an hour or less. My best 2020 time was 19 minutes 42 seconds (00:19:42) and my best rank was 1028.
